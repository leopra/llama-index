### A Meeting in Hyde Park

Paolo adjusted his scarf as he walked through the crisp autumn air of Hyde Park. The golden leaves crunched beneath his feet as he made his way toward the Serpentine Lake, where he had agreed to meet Marta. They had been friends since university, but it had been months since they last saw each other.

As he approached the water's edge, he spotted Marta sitting on their usual bench, feeding ducks with breadcrumbs from a paper bag. Her dark hair caught the afternoon sunlight, and she wore the same blue coat he remembered from their student days. When she looked up and saw him approaching, her face lit up with a warm smile.

"Paolo! You made it," Marta called out, standing to embrace her old friend. "I was beginning to think you'd gotten lost in the city."

"Never," Paolo laughed, hugging her tightly. "Though I must admit, London has changed quite a bit since we were here for that conference three years ago."

They spent the afternoon walking through the park, catching up on their lives, careers, and dreams. The conversation flowed as naturally as it always had, punctuated by comfortable silences as they watched families playing on the grass and tourists taking photos of the memorial fountains.

As the sun began to set, painting the sky in shades of orange and pink, they found themselves back at the lake. "Same time next year?" Marta asked, already knowing the answer.

"Wouldn't miss it for the world," Paolo replied, and they both knew that some friendships, like the timeless beauty of Hyde Park, never truly fade.
