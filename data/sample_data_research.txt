## The Evolution of Vector Databases

### Abstract
Vector databases have emerged as a critical infrastructure component for modern AI applications. This paper explores the evolution from traditional relational databases to vector-optimized storage systems, examining the technical challenges and architectural decisions that led to their development.

### Introduction
Traditional databases excel at storing and retrieving structured data through SQL queries, but they fall short when dealing with high-dimensional vector data generated by machine learning models. The rise of AI applications requiring semantic search, recommendation systems, and similarity matching has driven the need for specialized vector storage solutions.

### Key Concepts

#### High-Dimensional Vectors
Vectors in machine learning typically contain hundreds or thousands of dimensions, representing learned features from text, images, audio, or other data types. These embeddings capture semantic meaning in a way that traditional keyword matching cannot achieve.

#### Similarity Search Challenges
- **Curse of dimensionality**: Distance metrics become less meaningful in high dimensions
- **Computational complexity**: Brute force search scales poorly with data size
- **Memory requirements**: Storing and indexing large vector collections efficiently

#### Indexing Algorithms
Modern vector databases employ sophisticated indexing techniques:
- **Hierarchical Navigable Small World (HNSW)**: Graph-based approach with excellent recall-performance tradeoffs
- **Inverted File Index (IVF)**: Clustering-based method for large-scale datasets
- **Product Quantization (PQ)**: Compression technique reducing memory requirements
- **Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH)**: Probabilistic method for approximate nearest neighbor search

### Weaviate's Approach
